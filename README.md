# jmeter-maven-plugin-it

Integration test for the jmeter-maven-plugin.

The [Maven Verifier][1] is used to run the test.
It contains a `pom.xml` with a full configuration for the [JMeter Maven Plugin][2].

At the beginning the test, a [Jetty HTTP Server][3] is started, and a dummy webapp with an `index.html` is deployed.
After that, the JMeter testplan `test.jmx` requests the `index.html` 10 times.
After the JMeter test ends, the Jetty server is shut down again.

[Maven Verifier][1] then checks whether the plugin was executed without problems.


Run the test with `mvn clean verify`.
